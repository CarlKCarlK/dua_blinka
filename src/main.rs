// In bare-metal development, your application is launched by the processor's boot loader (from ROM).
// The boot loader typically jumps (doesn't make a function call) to your application's entry point.
// This is because there's nothing more for the boot loader to do.  By jumping instead of making a
// function call, the boot loader ensures there's nothing on the stack for your program to return to.

// This application defines `inner_main` because some of the app initialization is fallible and, as
// per the above comment, the entry point must never return.
// Rust's `!` is also not yet stable for use as anything other than a naked function return type.
// That is why `inner_main()` uses a locally-defined "never" type called `Never` which serves
// exactly the same purpose as `!`, inside a `Result`.
